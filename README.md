Food Order â€“ React Demo App

This is a simple Food Order frontend demo application built with React. It simulates a basic food ordering experience, including meal selection, cart management, and a checkout process.

Features

    Browse Meals: Users can view a list of available meals.

    Cart Functionality: Users can add or remove meals from the cart.

    Checkout Flow: Includes a form within a modal for submitting order details.

    Form Validation: Validates user input before allowing submission.

    Simulated Order Submission: Mimics a successful order and reloads the page afterward.

    Simulated Data Fetching: Meal data is loaded from a local JSON file with a simulated 3-second delay.

Notes

    This app is built as part of my journey to learn React and is intended solely for learning and demonstration purposes.

    Backend functionality is not included.

    All data and order processing are simulated in the frontend.
